    question: "How do credits work in Dealvinci?",
    answer:
      "Each check run consumes credits based on fetch complexity and volume. Your monthly plan includes a credit allowance, and usage resets each billing cycle.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens when I run out of credits?",
    answer:
      "Trackers pause when available credits are exhausted. You can either top up credits or upgrade your tier to keep monitoring active.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I switch tiers anytime?",
    answer:
      "Yes. You can move between Starter, Growth, and Scale at any time. Upgrades apply immediately, and downgrades apply on the next billing cycle.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do all plans include Telegram alerts?",
    answer:
      "Growth and Scale include full Telegram alert delivery and summaries. Starter gives basic monitoring so you can validate workflows before scaling.",
  },
  {
    question: "Who is Dealvinci best for?",
    answer:
      "Dealvinci is built for deal hunters, sourcing operators, and ecommerce teams who need dependable price monitoring without manual tab checking.",
